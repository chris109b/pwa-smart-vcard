# pwa-smart-vcard

This is a Progressive Web App (PWA) designed for our employees to use on a personal Smartphone. It displays a business card for work, a XMPP-ID and a business card for private use.

If you just want to use the application, go to: https://vcard.pixelpaper.org

This is a fork of "hi-smart-vcard" suitable for public use. It is the basically the same code without anything that refers Humboldt-Institut e.V. and anything that could cause any trademark issues.

There is only one function added to this fork: Users can change the organization name and homepage.
